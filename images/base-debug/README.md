# Base Debugging Image

This is the common base image for all containerized debugging images at Gepardec. 
It's built on **Debian 12 (Bookworm) Slim** and includes a set of essential networking, process, and file management utilities.

Other specialized debugging images (e.g., for Java, k8s ..) can extend this base image to provide additional tools.
